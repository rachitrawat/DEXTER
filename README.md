Age and Gender prediction using Wide Residual Networks

Abstractâ€”In this project, we introduce a deep learning solution
to age and gender estimation from a single face image. For both
prediction tasks, a single Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) of
Wide Residual Network (WRN-16-8) architecture is used. We
pose the age estimation problem as a deep classification problem
followed by a softmax expected value refinement. The network
was trained from scratch on IMDB faces and tested on WIKI
faces from the IMDB-WIKI dataset.
